					<h3>Research Topics</h3>
					<article>
						<h5>Type Systems for Graph rewriting</h5>
						<p>The goal is to verify type safety of rewrite rules targeting complicated graph structures rather than simple (algebraic) data structures (i.e., lists or trees). These are not typable with classic type systems in functional languages.</p>
					</article>
					<article>
						<h5>Lambda Calculus</h5>
						<p>The lambda calculus is highly well-known as the basis of functional languages. However, there are still many research areas that nobody have thoroughly explored before. For example, the following topics are actively researched even now: describing lambda terms as (hyper-)graphs and visualizing reduction graphs.</p>

						<p id="presentation-jssst2018" class="collapse">There are several interpreters for lambda calculus including Lambda*Magica. However, none of them has both usability (e.g., running on Web pages) and enough functionality (e.g., visualizing reduction graphs or defining macros). Then we implemented the new interpreter, named Lambda Friends, equipped with these features.</p>

In Proc. The 21st JSSST Workshop on Programming and Programming Languages (PPL 2019), 2019. (in Japanese, poster)</a></h5>
						<p id="presentation-ppl2019" class="collapse">LMNtal is a graph rewriting programming language, with which we can easily handle general graph structures. However, LMNtal programs may cause unexpected behavior since LMNtal has no features to report type errors. Then we should introduce static typing to LMNtal. LMNtal ShapeType is an existing research of static type system targeting LMNtal. In this research, we precisely reformulated LMNtal ShapeType and gave proofs for soundness and termination of the type checking before we solve known issues in LMNtal ShapeType. Then we introduced extensions such as basic types and compound types to improve the expressive power of the types.</p>

						<p id="presentation-jssst2019" class="collapse">A graph rewriting language LMNtal has aspects of both a programming language which expresses calculation by graph rewriting and a modeling language which can handle complicated graph structures. Also, we can use a design pattern called functional atoms in order to describe calculations with type transformation. On the other hand, since graph rewriting languages can handle a broader class of graph structures than lists or trees, formulation of static type system for those languages is not obvious. Structured Gamma is known as a static type system which verifies that graph structures will not be destroyed by graph rewriting. Therefore we shall introduce a static type system based on Structured Gamma for LMNtal. This paper proposes a type checking method for calculations with type transformation, using the type checking algorithm in Structured Gamma.</p>

						<p id="presentation-aplas2019" class="collapse">The ability to handle evolving graph structures is important both for programming languages and modeling languages. Of various languages that adopt graphs as primary data structures, a graph rewriting language LMNtal provides features and applications of both (concurrent) programming languages and modeling languages, and its implementation unifies ordinary program execution and model checking functionalities. Unlike pointer manipulation in imperative languages, LMNtal allows us to manipulate graph structures in such a way that the well-formedness of graphs is an invariant guaranteed by the language itself. However, since shapes of graphs can be more complex and diverse than algebraic data structures such as lists and trees, static type checking for describing and checking shapes of graphs handled by individual programs are highly useful. With this motivation, this paper discusses LMNtal ShapeType, a type checking framework that applies the basic idea of Shape Types to a concrete graph rewriting language. Features of LMNtal ShapeType include: (i) the type checking framework is formulated as a sublanguage of the host language and exploits the nondeterministic execution mechanism of LMNtal implementation straightforwardly for type checking; (ii) it is simple and yet can handle complex and diverse graph structures including skip lists, difference lists, red-black trees, lambda-graphs, and rectangular grids; (iii) constraints on shapes such as the balancing of trees can be handled within the framework; and (iv) the typing of functions, messages and data constructors can be handled within the framework in a uniform manner.</p>

						<p id="presentation-jssst2020" class="collapse">A graph rewriting language LMNtal has aspects of both a <strong>programming</strong> language that expresses computation by graph rewriting and a <strong>modeling</strong> language that can handle complicated graph structures. Furthermore, its implementation integrates both regular program execution and model checking.	In graph rewriting languages, we can handle a broader class of graph structures than algebraic data structures that can be handled by functional languages.	As a type checking method for rewrite rules, LMNtal ShapeType was proposed based on Structured Gamma, a static type checking method for graphs.	This paper proposes a type checking method for rewrite rules targeting graph types with numeric constraints (e.g., red-black trees) by using typed process context, which is an extension of LMNtal, as the index of nonterminal symbols.</p>

In this method, since types are defined as generative grammars written as LMNtal rules, type checking of LMNtal programs can be done by exploiting model checking features of LMNtal itself. We also gave a full implementation of type checking using the features of the LMNtal meta-interpreter.</p>
